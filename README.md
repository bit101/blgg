# blgg

bitlib library for gg (https://github.com/fogleman/gg)

Ported from blgo (https://github.com/bit101/blgo) which used a fork of go-cairo (http://github.com/bit101/go-cairo)

gg is a bit simpler and has no external dependencies.

## Install

    go get github.com/fogleman/gg
    go get github.com/bit101/blgg
